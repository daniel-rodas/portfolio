<p class=" text-center">
    Today I live to code. I am a technology enthusiast studying <span class="font-family-italic">Web Design &amp; New Media</span> in San Francisco at the Academy of Art University.
    Growing up I enjoyed Sci-Fi and actual science themes alike; think "Bill Nye the Science Guy."
    My name is <span class="font-family-bold">Daniel Rodas</span>, if you'd like to contact me via email, you may do so at <a href="mailto:daniel@rodasnet.com">Daniel@RodasNet.com.</a>
